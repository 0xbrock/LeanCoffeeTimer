This is my flavor of Lean Coffee.  There are many tweaks that can personalize it for the group; experiment!

+ 3 or more people (max size will vary, you'll have to judge for yourself)
+ 60 minutes

## Prerequisites
+ Room with table and chairs
+ Kanban board, I prefer [Trello](https://www.trello.com), but any Kanban works.  
+ Timer (this one works great)

## Set-up
1. All attendees sit around the table that they can see each other. The smaller the table the better.
2. Create a kanban board with the following lists:
    + Topics
    + To Discuss
    + Discussing
    + Discussed
    + Actionables
    Topics is the backlog list.  Actionables is not really needed, but if you want a place to track cards which have take-aways.
3. If you want to vote using Trello's voting power up, enable it.  Otherwise voting can be accomplished by having people add themselves to the card.

## Lean Coffee Process

### Go Over the Rules
Go over the rules helps make the whole experience run smoothly, even with experienced attendees.

### 1. Populate Topics Backlog
1. Populate Topics - Before the meeting have the attendees add discussion topics to the "Topics" list.
2. Clarify Topics - If there are any questions about topics in the list, clarify them before voting.
3. Vote on Topics - Attendees vote by voting on the card or adding themselves to the card.
4. Populate the To Discuss List - Move the topics with votes into the To Discuss list and sort descending. Cards with the same votes should be should be ordered randomly without thought of the topic.

### 2. And... Discuss
1. Start The New Topic - Move the hightest voted topic from "To Discuss" and place it into "Discussing". Start a timer for five minutes. The person who proposed the topic starts the discussion.
2. Vote - When the timer goes off, the current speaker finishes making their point, but no one responds to the point. Everyone now votes by thumbs up or thumbs down, simple majority wins.
    + If decrementing the timer results in a 0 timer, automatic majority thumbs down.
    + Majority thumbs up, decrement the timer by one minute and continue on the topic. After the timer alerts, vote again.
    + Majority thumbs down, move the topic from "Discussing" to "Discussed", then Start a New Topic.

NOTE: Each group will have to find the times and decrement values that work for the group.

### 3. Tear Down
If there are undiscussed topcs, move them back into the Topics backlog for discussion next time.  This is useful if the group meets periodically.

## The Original Lean Coffee
Lean Coffee was developed by [Jim Benson](http://twitter.com/ourfounder) and [Jeremy Lightsmith](http://twitter.com/lightsmith) as a way to explore topics and keep the conversation focused and moving.
